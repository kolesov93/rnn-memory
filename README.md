# rnn-memory
Simple experiment of rnn memory power - permuting mnist, damaging the input, checking model latency (in timestamps)

- `./run.py` to start or continue model training
- `./run.py draw` to show plots
- `./run.py damage` to evaluate how noising images affects quality
- `./run.py when` to calculate latency
